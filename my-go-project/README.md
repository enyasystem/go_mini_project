# My Go Project

This is a simple Go project that demonstrates the structure of a Go application. It includes basic arithmetic operations and serves as an entry point for further development.

## Project Structure

```
my-go-project
├── cmd
│   └── main.go        # Entry point of the application
├── pkg
│   └── utils.go       # Utility functions for arithmetic operations
├── go.mod             # Module definition file
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

## Getting Started

To build and run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-go-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Build the application:**
   ```
   go build -o my-go-app ./cmd
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```
   ./my-go-app
   ```

## Usage
